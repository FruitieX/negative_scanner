# negative_scanner

This is a Rust program that helps scan 35mm film negatives using a DSLR camera and a motorized negative feeder.

## Setup

Make sure you're running Rust v1.60 or above.

Setup instructions for Windows here: https://github.com/twistedfall/opencv-rust/issues/118#issuecomment-619608278

After that, I recommend using `cargo run --release` for best performance.
